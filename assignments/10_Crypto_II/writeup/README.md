### Part 2 (30 Pts)

1) First one can clearly tell the patterns and outlines of items depicted in the ECB encrypted image, even though the colors are hidden. The CBC encrypted image completely hides the items and the colors from the original image.

2) The ECB block cipher mode is less secure because it is a deterministic block cipher. If a block of plaintext happens to repeat then the same ciphertext will be generated by the ECB block cipher. CBC mode has an additional input for IV, which gets XOR'd with the plaintext block in order to introduce some randomness. Each ciphertext block is then XOR'd with the next plaintext block to keep introducing randomness for each successive block cipher encryption call.
