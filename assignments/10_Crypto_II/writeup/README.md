### Part 2 (30 Pts)

1) First one can clearly tell the patterns and outlines of items depicted in the ECB encrypted image, even though the colors are hidden. The CBC encrypted image completely hides the items and the colors from the original image.

2) The ECB block cipher mode is less secure because it is a deterministic block cipher.
