### Part 2 (75 pts)

After concluding the presence of vulnerabilities, I would first tell my boss and then only disclose the vulnerabilities to a consumer watchdog or the public after assessing the potential harm of those vulnerabilities. Making the public aware of these vulnerabilities before my company has time to appropriately react to and address them would give adversaries too much of an advantage over us, where they can use the revealed vulnerabilities during the time my company is patching them. 

The development team should prioritize the least complex security vulnerabilities or the most complex, because it would be a more efficient time investment to secure ECU’s firmware and whittle down the list of discovered vulnerabilities, especially if my company will not postpone the ECU’s release. With time as a valuable resource, dedicating more time to solving the most complex vulnerabilities would not decrease an adversaries attack surface as much as fixing more of the slightly simpler vulnerabilities.

If I do not do anything about these vulnerabilities, then I should be held accountable for the resulting harm. Withholding the knowledge of these vulnerabilities can lead to two possible situations: either these vulnerabilities are re-discovered later by another developer within my company or they are never discovered internally again. If another developer does act upon discovering these vulnerabilities, then my company now has even less time to address and respond to them, which could have been avoided if I announced the vulnerabilities sooner. If the vulnerabilities are never discovered, or discovered but un-announced by another person, then these vulnerabilities become latent issues that can always be available for adversaries to exploit. Either situation makes me responsible for costing the company even more resources to address the vulnerabilities or for putting drivers and occupants needlessly at risk to the harm from vulnerabilities in the ECU’s firmware.
