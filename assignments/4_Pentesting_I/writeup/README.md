## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

Flag: CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}

Steps to find flag:

1) Use 'nc 1337bank.money 1337' to connect to v0idcache's server
2) Ignore the prompt upon connecting
3) Use ';cd home;cat flag.txt' as the requested domain or IP
4) Flag is printed at end of dig output

Thought process:

* First read the linked wikipedia page about command injection.
* Then use 'nc 1337bank.money 1337' to first connect to assignment server
* Observe the output: A prompt appears for a domain or IP address
* Try 'umd.edu' just to test and observe a normal transaction
* Further saw DiG output for umd.edu from the server
* Reconnect to server and try 'umd.edu;ls' and see response. From the wikipedia page, the example programs showed how servers vulnerable to command injection add additional commands to the expected paramter.
* Output shows both the DiG output and the output of running 'ls' in the root directory
* Reconnect again, and this time use ';ls home/' to see what is in the home directory of the server
* DiG output appears, followed by the home directory contents. I then noticed the flag.txt file there
* Reconnect and use ';cat home/flag.txt' to get flag file contents
* CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion} was attached at the end of the DiG output

Recommendation:

Process all data being sent to the server before use, specifically any of the following:
* Ignore any input that includes a semicolon
* Check input against a regex for domain names and IP addresses
 

### Part 2 (60 pts)

stub.py is my implementation of a shell that leverages the command injection vulnerability in v0idcache's server.
